Just playing around with some LED effects for use on WS2812 circles/rings.  
Kinda haphazard, not particularly good, but still a bit of fun.

So far it's pretty much just simple wipes and gradients -- basic but alright.  
Might try to add some cool stuff with noise later.

Uses Arduino IDE+FastLED, and unlike common convention assumes the "strip"
starts at the centre of the circle (this is subject to change).

Works alright on the Wokwi simulator.

I don't really have any plans for this at the moment. If you want to use this
code feel free, but issues will likely be ignored.
